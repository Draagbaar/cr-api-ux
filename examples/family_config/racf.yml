    The **Reddit Alpha Clan Family** (RACF) consists of 8 trophy-pushing clans.

    Our clan family is home to many of Clash Royaleâ€™s greatest tournament players,
    three of whom made it to the Crown Duel.
    We have 2 clans on the **global leaderboard** with **Reddit Alpha** consistently in the top 20
    and **Reddit Bravo** consistently in the top 200.
    Every clan in our family finishes the clan crown chest early every time.
